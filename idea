Idea Title:

Automation of Held Task Reporting to Optimize Job License Usage in Control-M

Problem Statement:

Currently, held tasks in Control-M consume licenses without contributing to productive workflow execution. This results in inefficiencies and increased operational costs. Many teams lack visibility into the cumulative impact of held tasks on license usage.

Proposed Solution:

Develop an automated solution using the Control-M API to:
	1.	Generate Held Task Reports: Fetch and analyze held tasks in Control-M using the API, providing details such as job name, owner, hold duration, and license impact.
	2.	Optimization Recommendations: Suggest actionable steps to minimize license consumption, such as releasing or rescheduling held tasks.
	3.	Integration & Alerts: Integrate with existing dashboards or set up notifications for prolonged held tasks to enable proactive intervention.

Key Benefits:
	1.	Cost Savings: Reduce unnecessary license usage by identifying and addressing held tasks efficiently.
	2.	Improved Resource Utilization: Ensure job licenses are utilized effectively across teams.
	3.	Enhanced Collaboration: Provide visibility into license usage for all stakeholders, promoting accountability.
	4.	Scalability: Enable other teams to adapt this solution to their workflows seamlessly.

Implementation Steps:
	1.	API Setup: Use the Control-M API to fetch data on held tasks.
	2.	Script Development: Write scripts to parse data and generate actionable insights.
	3.	Testing: Run the solution in a controlled environment and refine based on feedback.
	4.	Deployment: Deploy the solution for organization-wide use.
	5.	Documentation: Create user guides for other teams to adapt the solution.

Additional Opportunities:
	•	Centralized Dashboard: Combine data from multiple teams for a unified view of license usage.
	•	Periodic Reports: Schedule weekly or monthly reports for leadership reviews.

Conclusion:

This solution aligns with organizational goals of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. By enabling proactive license management, it empowers teams to maximize the value of Control-M while reducing operational overhead.
