To modify your script so that it downloads all the contents of subfolders when there are multiple lines in the text file, you can use a loop to process each line in the source_nexus_artifacts.txt file. Below is the updated script:

#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the path to ctm_ag_mnt folder
BASE_PATH=$(pwd)/ctm_ag_mnt

# Prompt for Nexus credentials
NEXUS_USERNAME=$1
NEXUS_PASSWORD=$2
echo

# Loop through each subfolder in ctm_ag_mnt
for SUBFOLDER in "agent_toolkit" "bmc" "jre" "rpm" "scripts"; do
    # Define the path to the text file
    TEXT_FILE="$BASE_PATH/$SUBFOLDER/source_nexus_artifacts.txt"

    # Check for the text file
    if [ -f "$TEXT_FILE" ]; then
        # Read each line from the text file
        while IFS= read -r NEXUS_URL || [ -n "$NEXUS_URL" ]; do
            echo "Processing URL: $NEXUS_URL"
            
            # Download the file using curl
            curl -u "$NEXUS_USERNAME:$NEXUS_PASSWORD" -sS -o "$BASE_PATH/$SUBFOLDER/$(basename "$NEXUS_URL")" "$NEXUS_URL"
            
            # Check if the download was successful
            if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                echo "File downloaded successfully in $SUBFOLDER"
                
                # Unzip the file if in 'scripts' folder
                if [[ $SUBFOLDER == "scripts" ]]; then
                    unzip -qo "$BASE_PATH/$SUBFOLDER/$(basename "$NEXUS_URL")" -d "$BASE_PATH/$SUBFOLDER"
                fi
            else
                echo "Failed to download file from $NEXUS_URL in $SUBFOLDER"
            fi
        done < "$TEXT_FILE"
    else
        echo "Text file $TEXT_FILE not found in $SUBFOLDER"
    fi
done

Changes Made:

1. Read Multiple Lines: Added a while loop to read each URL line from the source_nexus_artifacts.txt file.


2. File Validation: Ensures that the script processes even if the text file has empty lines.


3. Error Handling: Added proper error handling to show which URL failed.


4. Unzip Logic: Keeps the unzip functionality for the scripts folder.



Usage:

Run the script with your Nexus username and password as arguments:

bash download_nexus_files.sh <NEXUS_USERNAME> <NEXUS_PASSWORD>

Ensure the source_nexus_artifacts.txt file in each subfolder contains valid URLs, one per line. Let me know if you need further assistance!
